## This is racf.guru

I really only bought this domain for the email but figured I may as well put _some_ content up alongside it. More content may follow but this will do for now.  

### My stuff  
[z/OS tools](https://github.com/jaytay79/zos) - SETRRCVT and some other bits and pieces  
[IRRXUTIL samples](https://github.com/jaytay79/IRRXUTIL) - Samples of IRRXUTIL  
[ENUM](https://github.com/mainframed/Enumeration) - Enumeration Rexx in collaboration with SoF & Ayoul3  
[Probable Wordlists](https://github.com/jaytay79/Probable-Wordlists/tree/RACF/Real-Passwords) - Passwords edited to conform to UPPERCASE and 8 character max standards
